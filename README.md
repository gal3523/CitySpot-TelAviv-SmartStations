# City Spot - Smart Urban Information Station (TLV Info Station)

City Spot is a smart, solar-powered urban information station designed to provide real-time assistance, accessibility, and city services for residents, tourists, and people with disabilities.

The project was developed during a hackathon in collaboration with **Tel Aviv Municipality**, based on a major urban opportunity identified in the city’s existing infrastructure.

## Urban Opportunity

According to Tel Aviv Municipality, the city currently has:

- 176 public electrical charging stations 
- originally used for a shared electric-bike program 
- which now remain **unused** 
- even though they are fully powered and connected to the municipal grid
  
These abandoned stations represent **valuable urban infrastructure** that can be repurposed into modern, accessible, multi-functional smart stations.

At the same time, there is a growing need for:
- Accessible and smart information points  
- Real-time navigation and city services  
- Solutions for tourists, residents, and individuals with disabilities  

## Problem Statement
Tel Aviv has **existing public electrical infrastructure** – specifically 176 former e-bike charging posts – that is currently **not being utilized**.

Challenges created by this situation:
- Public infrastructure stands idle instead of serving city residents  
- Setting up new smart stations is expensive and requires construction  
- Demand for smart municipal information services continues to grow  
- The city needs solutions that leverage **existing assets** instead of building new ones

There is a unique opportunity to transform these abandoned charging stations into **smart urban service points** that are useful, accessible, and sustainable.
